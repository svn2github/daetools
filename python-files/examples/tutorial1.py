This tutorial introduces several new concepts:
 - Distribution domains
 - Distributed parameters, variables and equations
 - Boundary and initial conditions

In this example we model a simple heat conduction problem: 
   - a conduction through a very thin, rectangular copper plate.
This example should be sufficiently complex to describe all basic DAE Tools features. 
For this problem, we need a two-dimensional Cartesian grid in X and Y axis 
(here, for simplicity, divided into 10 x 10 segments):

Y axis
    ^
    |
Ly -| T T T T T T T T T T T
    | L + + + + + + + + + R
    | L + + + + + + + + + R 
    | L + + + + + + + + + R
    | L + + + + + + + + + R
    | L + + + + + + + + + R

    | L + + + + + + + + + R
    | L + + + + + + + + + R
 0 -| B B B B B B B B B B B
    --|-------------------|----> X axis
      0                   Lx
     
Points 'B' at the bottom edge of the plate (for y = 0), and the points 'T' at the top edge of the plate 
(for y = Ly) represent the points where the heat is applied.
The plate is considered insulated at the left (x = 0) and the right edges (x = Lx) of the plate (points 'L' and 'R'). 
To model this type of problem, we have to write a heat balance equation for all interior points except the left, right, 
top and bottom edges, where we need to define the Neumann type boundary conditions. 

In this problem we have to define the following domains:
 - x: X axis domain, length Lx = 0.1 m 
 - y: Y axis domain, length Ly = 0.1 m 

the following parameters:
 - ro: copper density, 8960 kg/m3
 - cp: copper specific heat capacity, 385 J/(kgK)
 - k:  copper heat conductivity, 401 W/(mK)
 - Qb: heat flux at the bottom edge of the plate, 1E6 W/m2 (or 100 W/cm2)
 - Qt: heat flux at the top edge of the plate, here set to 0 W/m2
 
and the following variable:
 - T: the temperature of the plate, K (distributed on x and y domains)

Also, we need to write the following 5 equations:

1) Heat balance:
      ro * cp * dT(x,y) / dt = k * (d2T(x,y) / dx2 + d2T(x,y) / dy2);  for all x in: (0, Lx),
                                                                       for all y in: (0, Ly) 

2) Boundary conditions for the bottom edge:
      -k * dT(x,y) / dy = Qin;  for all x in: [0, Lx],
                                and y = 0

3) Boundary conditions for the top edge:
      -k * dT(x,y) / dy = Qin;  for all x in: [0, Lx],
                                and y = Ly

4) Boundary conditions for the left edge:
      dT(x,y) / dx = 0;  for all y in: (0, Ly),
                         and x = 0

5) Boundary conditions for the right edge:
      dT(x,y) / dx = 0;  for all y in: (0, Ly),
                         and x = Ln
