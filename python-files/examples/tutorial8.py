"""
In this example we use a similar problem as in the tutorial 5.
Here we introduce:
 - Custom data reporters

Some time it is not enough to send the result to daePlotter but it is desirable to 
export them in certain format for use in other programs. Here we show how the custom
data reporter can be created. In this example the data reporter simply, after the simulation
is finished, save the results into a plain text file. Obviously, the data can be exported to
any format. Also some numpy functions that operate on numpy arrays can be used as well.
In addition, a new type of data reporters (daeDelegateDataReporter) is presented. It
has the same interface and the functionality like all data reporters. However, it does not do
any data processing by itself but calls the corresponding functions of data reporters which 
are added to it by using the function AddDataReporter. This way it is possible, at the same 
time, to send the results to the daePlotter and save them into a file (or process them in
some other ways).

# The best starting point in creating custom data reporters that can export the results 
# into a file is daeDataReporterLocal class. It internally does all the processing
# and offers a user the Process property of type daeDataReporterProcess which contains
# all domains and variables sent by simulation. The following functions have to be implemented:
#  - Connect
#    It is used to connect the data reporter. In the case when the local data reporter is used
#    it may contain a file name, for instance.
#  - Disconnect
#    Disconnects the data reporter.
#  - IsConnected
#    Check if the data reporter is connected or not.
# In this example we use the first argument of the function Connect as a file name to open 
# a text file and implement a new function Write to write the data into the file.
# In the function Write we iterate over all variables and write their values into a file.
