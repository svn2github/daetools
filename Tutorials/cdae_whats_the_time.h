What is the time? (AKA Hello world!) is a very simple simulation.
It shows the basic structure of the model and the simulation classes.
A typical simulation imcludes 8 basic tasks:
    1. How to import the pyDAE module
    2. How to declare variable types
    3. How to define a model by deriving a class from the base daeModel, what are the methods
       that must be implemented by every model, and how to define an equation and its residual
    4. How to define a simulation by deriving a class from the base daeSimulation, what are the methods
       that must be implemented by every simulation, and how to set initial conditions
    5. How to create auxiliary objects required for the simulation (DAE solver, data reporter and logging objects)
    6. How to set simulation's additional settings
    7. How to connect a data reporter
    8. How to run a simulation
*/

/* 1. Include either 'variable_types.h' or 'dae_develop.h' header (if you do not need pre-defined variable types)*/
#include "variable_types.h"
#include "../dae_develop.h"

/* 2. Define variable types
   Variable types are typically declared outside of model classes since they define common, reusable types.
   Pre-defined variable types are declared in the 'variable_types.h' header.
   The daeVariable constructor takes 6 arguments:
    - Name: string
    - Units: string
    - LowerBound: float
    - UpperBound: float
    - InitialGuess: float
    - AbsoluteTolerance: float
   Here, a very simple variable type is declared:

/*
    3.1 Declare domains/parameters/variables/ports
        All domains, parameters, variables, ports etc has to be declared as members of
        the new model class (except equations which are handled by the framework), since the base class
        keeps only their references. 
        Domains, parameters, variables, ports, etc has to be defined in the constructor
        First, the base class constructor has to be called.
        In this example we declare only one variable: time.
        daeVariable constructor accepts 3 arguments:
         - Name: string
         - VariableType: daeVariableType
         - Parent: daeModel object (indicating the model where the variable will be added)
         - Description: string (optional argument - the variable description; the default value is an empty string)
        Variable names can consists of letters, numbers, underscore ('_') and no other special characters (' ', '.', ',', '/', '-', etc).
        However, there is an exception. You can use the standards html code names, such as Greek characters: &alpha; &beta; &gamma; etc.
        Internally they will be used without '&' and ';' characters: alpha, beta, gamma, ...;
        but, in the equations exported in the MathML or Latex format they will be shown as native Greek letters.
        Also if you write the variable name as: Name_1 it will be transformed into Name with the subscript 1.
        In this example we use Greek character 'tau' to name the variable 'time'.

    3.2 Declare equations and state transition networks
        Here we declare only one equation. Equations are created by the function CreateEquation in daeModel class.
        It accepts two arguments: equation name and description (optional). All naming conventions apply here as well.
        Equations are written in the form of a residual, which is accepted by DAE equation system solvers:
                                'residual expression' = 0
        Residuals are defined by creating the above expression by using the basic mathematical operations (+, -, * and /)
        and functions (sqrt, log, sin, cos, max, min, ...) on variables and parameters. Variables define several useful functions:
            - operator () which calculates the variable value
            - function dt() which calculates a time derivative of the variable
            - function d() and d2() which calculate a partial derivative of the variable of the 1st and the 2nd order, respectively
        In this example we simply write that the variable time derivative is equal to 1:
                                d(time) / dt = 1
        which calculates the time as the current time elapsed in the simulation (which is a common way to obtain the current time within the model).
        Note that the variables should be accessed through the model object, therefore we use self.time
