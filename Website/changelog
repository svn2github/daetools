daetools (1.0-5) stable; urgency=low

  * Added opearators + - * / that accept mixed adouble and adouble_array 
    arguments. As a result, they return an adouble_array of the same size as 
    the adouble_array argument
  * Added functions d {partial derivative} and dt {derivative per time} to 
    daeModel class. Only opearators + - * / are supported. They take 
    expression as an argument and evaluate its time or partial derivative.
  * Added about box to daePlotter and license information.
  * Added daetools.cfg {in .info file format}. All core libraries use the 
    settings from that file.
  * Added two new functions to daeModel:
    - SaveModelReport {replaced the global daeSaveModel function}
    - SaveRuntimeModelReport to export the runtime information about a 
      simulation. It is basically equivalent to the model report with 
      added equations after a discretization.
  * Added support for initialization of complex models. Values of model 
    variables now can be exported to a binary file and used later during 
    the initialization. Two new functions are added to daeSimulation: 
    Load/StoreInitializationValues
    The file format is:
    - NoVariables (number of variables): 32 bit unsigned integer;
    - Variable values: array of size [NoVariables] of 64 bit 
      (double precision) floating point numbers;
  * Fixed functions Pause and Resume in daeDynamicActivity enabling pausing 
    and resuming of a simulation. Mutexes are not used any more.
  * Improved daeSimulator to support Pause and Resume functions
  * Modified installation packages so that the file permissions, owner and 
    group are fixed.
  * Updated documentation {installing, getting started and user guide}
  * Debian packages pass Lintian test with no errors. 
  * All tutorials modified so that they support two execution modes:
    - gui (with daeSimulator GUI);
    - console
    The execution modes are specified at the command line:
      python tutorial.py gui
      python tutorial.py console
    Default is gui.

daetools (1.0-4) stable; urgency=low

  * Fixed functions sum, product, integral, average, min, max that operate on 
    adouble_array objects
  * Fixed functions sqrt, exp, log, log10, abs, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan
    that operate on adouble_array objects
  * Installer packages for some of the oses/platforms were not built to 
    support Trilinos Amesos with SuperLU and Umfpack libraires; fixed now
  * Added function SetActiveState(string) to daeSTN class in cDAE and pyDAE
  * Few tutorial updates
  * Some other minor fixes

daetools (1.0-3) stable; urgency=low

  * Added Trilinos Amesos support for Umfpack
  * Finalized Debian Lenny armel port
  * pyDAE module separated into four modules: pyCore, pyDataReporting, 
    pySolver, pyActivity
  * @QtCore.pyqtSlot (the new slot style) removed; the old slot style is in 
    use now (because the default qt version in Debian Lenny is 4.4; 4.5+ is 
    required for the new style)
  * Added daeSimulator
  * daeRunExamples adapted to use daeSimulator
  * Atlas Lapack LA solver removed
  * Some other minor fixes
