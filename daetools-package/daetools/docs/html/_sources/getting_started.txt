This chapter gives the basic information about what is needed to develop a model of a process, how to simulate/optimize
it and how to obtain and plot the results of a process simulation/optimization. In general, the simulation/optimization
of a process consists of three tasks:

#. Modelling of a proces
#. Defining a simulation/optimization
#. Processing the results

Programming language
====================
**DAE Tools** core libraries are written in standard c++. However, `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ programming language is
used as the main modelling language. The main reason for use of Python is (as the authors say):
*"Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple
but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its
interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on
most platforms"* `link <http://docs.python.org/tutorial>`_. 

And: "*Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no
compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast"* `link <http://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb>`_. Also, please
have a look on `a comparison to the other languages <http://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons>`_. Based on the information
available online, and according to the personal experience, the python programs are much shorter and take an order of magnitude
less time to develop it. Initially I developed daePlotter module in c++; it took me about one month of part time coding. But,
then I moved to python: reimplementing it in PyQt took me just two days (with several new features added), while the code size
shrank from 24 cpp modules to four python modules only!

*"Where Python code is typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java code, it is often 5-10 times shorter than equivalent
C++ code! Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't
complete in a year. Python shines as a glue language, used to combine components written in C++"*
`link <http://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons>`_.
Obviously, not everything can be developed in python; for complex projects I still prefer the heavy c++ artillery.

The main concepts
=================

**DAE Tools** contains 5 modules:

* Core
* Activity
* DataReporting
* IDAS
* Units
    
Core module
-----------

Core module defines the main modelling concepts:

* **Model**
 A model of the process is a simplified abstraction of real world process/phenomena describing its most important/driving elements and their interactions. In **DAE Tools** models are created by defining their parameters, distribution domains, variables, equations, and ports.

 * **Distribution domain**
  Domain is a general term used to define an array of different objects (parameters, variables, equations but models and ports as well).

 * **Parameter**
  Parameter can be defined as a time invariant quantity that will not change during a simulation.

 * **Variable**
  Variable can be defined as a time variant quantity, also called a *state variable*.

 * **Equation**
  Equation can be defined as an expression used to calculate a variable value, which can be created
  by performing basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, /) and functions (such as sin, cos, tan, sqrt, log, ln, exp, pow, abs etc)
  on parameter and variable values (and time and partial derivatives as well).

 * **State transition network**
  State transition networks are used to model a special type of equations:
  *discontinuous equation*s. Discontinuous equations are equations that take different forms subject to certain conditions.
  They are composed of a finite number of *states*.

 * **State**
  States can be defined as a set of actions (in our case a set of equations) under current operating conditions.
  In addition, every state contains a set of state transitions which describe conditions
  when the state changes occur.

 * **State Transition**
  State transition can be defined as a transition from the current to some other state, subject to given conditions.

 * **Port**
  Ports are objects used to connect two model instances and exchange continuous information.
  Like models, they may contain domains, parameters and variables.

 * **EventPort**
  Event ports are objects used to connect two model instances and exchange discrete information (events/messages).

* **Simulation**
 Simulation of a process can be considered as the model run for certain input conditions.
 To define a simulation, several tasks are necessary such as: specifying information about domains and parameters,
 fixing the degrees of freedom by assigning values to certain variables, setting the initial conditions and many other
 (setting the initial guesses, absolute tolerances, etc).

* **Optimization**
 Process optimization can be considered as a process adjustment so as to minimize or maximize a specified goal while
 satisfying imposed set of constraints. The most common goals are minimizing cost, maximizing throughput, and/or
 efficiency. In general there are three types of parameters that can be adjusted to affect optimal performance:

 * Equipment optimization
 * Operating procedures
 * Control optimization

* **Solver**
 Solver is a set of mathematical procedures/algorithms necessary to solve a given set of equations.
 There are several types of solvers: Linear Algebraic solvers (**LA**), used to solve linear systems of equations;
 Nonlinear Algebraic solvers (**NLA**), used to solve non-linear systems of equations; Differential Algebraic solvers
 (**DAE**), used to solve mixed systems of differential and algebraic equations; Nonlinear Programming solvers (**NLP**),
 used to solve nonlinear optimization problems; Mixed-integer Nonlinear Programming solvers (**MINLP**), used to solve
 mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems. In **DAE Tools** it is possible to choose **DAE**
 (currently only `Sundials IDAS <https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html>`_), **NLP/MINLP**
 (currently `IPOPT/BONMIN <https://projects.coin-or.org/Bonmin>`_
 and `NLOPT <http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt>`_),
 and **LA** solvers (built-in Sundials LA solvers; `Trilinos Amesos <http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/amesos>`_;
 `Trilinos AztecOO <http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/aztecoo>`_;
 `SuperLU/SuperLU_MT <http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/index.html>`_;
 `Intel MKL <http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl>`_; `AMD ACML <http://www.amd.com/acml>`_).
    
* **Data Reporter**
 Data reporter is defined as an object used to report the results of a simulation/optimization.
 They can either keep the results internally (and export them into a file, for instance) or send them via
 TCP/IP protocol to the **DAE Tools** plotter.
    
* **Data Receiver**
 Data receiver can be defined as on object which duty is to receive the results from a data reporter.
 These data can be later plotted or processed in some other ways.
    
* **Log**
 Log is defined as an object used to send messages from the various parts of **DAE Tools** framework
 (messages from solvers or simulation).

Running a simulation
====================

Two steps are needed to run a simulation:

1. Start **daePlotter**:

 * **In GNU/Linux and MacOS:**
  Go to: **Applications/Programming/daePlotter** or type the following shell command: **daeplotter**
 * **In Windows:**
  Go to: **Start/Programs/DAE Tools/daePlotter**
  The **daePlotter** main window should appear (given in :ref:`Figure 1. <Figure-1>`)

    .. _Figure-1:
    .. figure:: _static/Screenshot-DAEPlotter.png
       :width: 250 pt
       :figwidth: 300 pt
       :align: center

       **Figure 1.** daePlotter main window.

 **daePlotter** can be also added to a panel. Simply add a custom application launcher (command: daeplotter).

2. Start **DAE Tools Examples** program to try some examples:

 * **In GNU/Linux and MacOS:**
  Go to: **Applications/Programming/DAE Tools Examples**
  or type the following shell command: **daeexamples**
 * **In Windows:**
  Go to: **Start/Programs/DAE Tools/DAE Tools Examples**

In general, simulations are started by typing the following shell commands (GNU/Linux and Windows):
figwidth
.. code-block:: bash

    cd "directory where simulation file is located"
    python mySimulation.py

The main window of **DAE Tools Examples** application is given in :ref:`Figure 2a. <Figure-2a>` while the output from the simulation run
in :ref:`Figure 2b. <Figure-2b>`. Users can select one of several tutorials, run them, and inspect their source code or model reports.
Model reports open in a new window of the system's default web browser (however, only Mozilla Firefox is currently supported
because of the MathML rendering issue).

Running an optimization
=======================

Running the optimization problems is analogous to running a simulation.


Model development
=================

In general, three approaches to process modelling exist ([#Morton2003]_):

 * Sequential Modular (**SeqM**) approach
 * Simultaneous Modular (**SimM**) approach
 * Equation-Oriented (**EO**) approach

The pros & cons of the first two approaches are extensively studied in the literature. Under the **EO** approach we generate
and gather together all equations and variables which constitute the model representing the process. The equations are solved
simultaneously using a suitable mathematical algorithm (Morton, 2003 [#Morton2003]_). Equation-oriented simulation requires
simultaneous solution of a set of differential algebraic equations (**DAE**) which itself requires a solution of a set of
nonlinear algebraic equations (**NLAE**) and linear algebraic equations (**LAE**). The Newton's method or some variant of it
is almost always used to solve problems described by NLAEs. A brief history of Equation-Oriented solvers and comparison of
**SeqM** and **EO** approaches as well as descriptions of the simultaneous modular and equation-oriented methods can be found
in Morton, 2003 ([#Morton2003]_). Also a good overview of the equation-oriented approach and its application in
`gPROMS <http://www.psenterprise.com/gproms>`_ is given by Barton & Pantelides ([#Pantelides1]_, [#Pantelides2]_, [#Pantelides3]_).

**DAE Tools** use the Equation-Oriented approach to process modelling, and the following types of processes can be modelled:

 * Lumped and distributed
 * Steady-state and dynamic

Problems can be formulated as linear, non-linear, and (partial) differential algebraic systems (of index 1).
The most common problems are initial value problems of implicit form. Equations can be ordinary or discontinuous,
where discontinuities are automatically handled by the framework. A good overview of discontinuous equations and
a procedure for location of equation discontinuities is given by Park & Barton ([#ParkBarton]_)
and in `Sundials IDA <https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/documentation/ida_guide/node3.html#SECTION00330000000000000000 documentation>`_
(used in DAE Tools).

Models
------

In **DAE Tools** models are created by defining its parameters, distribution domains, variables, equations, and ports.
Models are developed by deriving a new class from the base model class (:py:class:`pyCore.daeModel`).
The process consists of two steps:

 #. Declare all domains, parameters, variables and ports in :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeModel.__init__` function (the constructor)
 #. Declare equations and state transition networks in :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeModel.DeclareEquations` function

Models in **pyDAE** (using python programming language) can be defined by the following statement:

.. code-block:: python

    class myModel(daeModel):
        def __init__(self, Name, Parent = None, Description = ""):
            daeModel.__init__(self, Name, Parent, Description)
            ... (here go declarations of domains, parameters, variables, ports, etc)

        def DeclareEquations(self):
            ... (here go declarations of equations and state transitions)

while in **cDAE** (using c++ programming language):

.. code-block:: cpp

    class myModel : public daeModel
    {
    public:
        myModel(string strName, daeModel* pParent = NULL, string strDescription = "")
        : daeModel(strName, pParent, strDescription)
        {
            ... (here go additional properties of domains, parameters, variables, ports, etc)
        }

        void DeclareEquations(void)
        {
            ... (here go declarations of equations and state transitions)
        }

    public:
        ... (here go declarations of domains, parameters, variables, ports, etc)
    };

More information about developing models can be found in :doc:`pyDAE_user_guide` and :py:class:`pyCore.daeModel`.
Also, do not forget to have a look on :doc:`tutorials`.

Distribution domains
--------------------
There are two types of domains in **DAE Tools**: simple arrays and distributed domains (commonly used to distribute variables, 
parameters and equations in space). The distributed domains can have a uniform (default) or a user specified non-uniform grid.
At the moment, only the following finite difference methods can be used to calculate partial derivatives:

 * Backward finite difference method (BFD)
 * Forward finite difference method (FFD)
 * Center finite difference method (CFD)

In **DAE Tools** just anything can be distributed on domains: parameters, variables, equations even models and ports.
Obviously it does not have a physical meaning to distribute a model on a domain, However that can be useful for modelling
of complex processes where we can create an array of models where each point in a distributed domain have a corresponding
model so that a user does not have to take care of number of points in the domain, etc. In addition, domain points values
can be obtained as a **NumPy** one-dimensional array; this way **DAE Tools** can be easily used in conjuction with other
scientific python libraries `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_, `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org>`_, for instance and many
`other <http://www.scipy.org/Projects>`_.

Domains in **pyDAE** can be defined by the following statement:

.. code-block:: python

    myDomain = daeDomain("myDomain", Parent_Model_or_Port, Description)

while in **cDAE**:

.. code-block:: cpp

    daeDomain myDomain("myDomain", &Parent_Model_or_Port, Description);

More information about domains can be found in :doc:`pyDAE_user_guide` and :py:class:`pyCore.daeDomain`.
Also, do not forget to have a look on :doc:`tutorials`.

Parameters
----------

There are two types of parameters in **DAE Tools**: ordinary and distributed. Several functions to get a parameter
value (function call operator :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeParameter.__call__`) and array of values
(:py:meth:`~pyCore.daeParameter.array`) have been defined. In addition, distributed parameters have
:py:attr:`~pyCore.daeParameter.npyValues` property to get the values as a numpy multi-dimensional array.

Parameters in **pyDAE** can be defined by the following statement:

.. code-block:: python

    myParam = daeParameter("myParam", eReal, Parent_Model_or_Port, "Description")

while in **cDAE**:

.. code-block:: cpp

    daeParameter myParam("myParam", eReal, &Parent_Model_or_Port, "Description");

More information about parameters can be found in :doc:`pyDAE_user_guide` and :py:class:`pyCore.daeParameter`.
Also, do not forget to have a look on :doc:`tutorials`.

Variables
---------
There are two types of variables in **DAE Tools**: ordinary and distributed. Functions to get a variable value
(function call operator :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.__call__`), a time or a partial derivative
(:py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.dt`, :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.d`, or :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.d2`) or
functions to obtain an array of values, time or partial derivatives (:py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.array`,
:py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.dt_array`, :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.d_array`, or :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.d2_array`)
have been defined. In addition, distributed variables have :py:attr:`~pyCore.daeVariable.npyValues` property to get
the values as a numpy multi-dimensional array.

Variables in **pyDAE** can be defined by the following statement:

.. code-block:: python

    myVar = daeVariable("myVar", variableType, Parent_Model_or_Port, "Description")

while in **cDAE**:

.. code-block:: cpp

    daeVariable myVar("myVar", variableType, &Parent_Model_or_Port, "Description");

More information about variables can be found in :doc:`pyDAE_user_guide` and :py:class:`pyCore.daeVariable`.
Also, do not forget to have a look on :doc:`tutorials`.

Equations
---------
**DAE Tools** introduce two types of equations: ordinary and distributed. What makes distributed
equations special is that an equation expression is valid on every point within the domains that
the equations is distriibuted on. Equations can be distributed on a whole domain, on a part of it
or on some of the points in a domain. Equations in **pyDAE** can be defined by the following statement:

.. code-block:: python

    eq = model.CreateEquation("myEquation", "Description")

while in **cDAE**:

.. code-block:: cpp

    daeEquation* eq = model.CreateEquation("myEquation", "Description");

To define an equation expression (used to calculate its residual and its gradient - which represent a single row in a
Jacobian matrix) **DAE Tools** combine the
`operator overloading <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Operator_overloading>`_ 
technique for `automatic differentiation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation>`_
(adopted from `ADOL-C <https://projects.coin-or.org/ADOL-C>`_ library) with the concept of representing equations as
**evaluation trees**. Evaluation trees are made of binary or unary nodes, itself representing four basic mathematical
operations and frequently used mathematical functions, such as ``sin, cos, tan, sqrt, pow, log, ln, exp, min, max, floor, ceil,
abs, sum, product, ...``. These basic mathematical operations and functions are implemented to operate on **a heavily
modified ADOL-C** library class :py:class:`~pyCore.adouble` (which has been extended to contain information about
domains/parameters/variables etc). In adition, a new :py:class:`~pyCore.adouble_array` class has been introduced to apply all
above-mentioned operations on arrays of variables.
What is different here is that :py:class:`~pyCore.adouble`/:py:class:`~pyCore.adouble_array` classes and mathematical
operators/functions work in two modes; they can either **build-up an evaluation tree** or **calculate a value of an expression**.
Once built the evaluation trees can be used to calculate equation residuals or derivatives to fill a Jacobian matrix
necessary for a Newton-type iteration. A typical evaluation tree is presented in :ref:`Figure 4. <Figure-4>`.

.. _Figure-4:
.. figure:: _static/EvaluationTree.png
   :width: 250 pt
   :figwidth: 300 pt
   :align: center

   **Figure 4.** DAE Tools equation evaluation tree

As it has been noted before, domains, parameters, and variables contain functions that return
:py:class:`~pyCore.adouble`/:py:class:`~pyCore.adouble_array` objects, which can be used to calculate
residuals and derivatives. These functions include functions to get a value of
a domain/parameter/variable (function call operator), to get a time or a partial derivative of a variable
(functions :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.dt`, :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.d`, or :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.d2`)
or functions to obtain an array of values, time or partial derivatives (:py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.array`,
:py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.dt_array`, :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.d_array`, or :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeVariable.d2_array`).
Another useful feature of **DAE Tools** equations is that they can be
exported into MathML or Latex format and easily visualized.

For example, the equation *F* (given in :ref:`Figure 4. <Figure-4>`) can be defined in **pyDAE** by using the following
statements:

.. code-block:: python

    F = model.CreateEquation("F", "F description")
    F.Residal = V14.dt() + V1() / (V14() + 2.5) + Sin(3.14 * V3())

while in **cDAE** by:

.. code-block:: cpp

    daeEquation* F = model.CreateEquation("F", "F description");
    F->SetResidal( V14.dt() + V1() / (V14() + 2.5) + sin(3.14 * V3()) );

More information about equations can be found in :doc:`pyDAE_user_guide` and :py:class:`pyCore.daeEquation`.
Also, do not forget to have a look on :doc:`tutorials`.

State Transition Networks (discontinuous equations)
---------------------------------------------------

Discontinuous equations are equations that take different forms subject to certain conditions. For example,
if we want to model a flow through a pipe we may observe three different flow regimes:

* Laminar: if Reynolds number is less than 2,100
* Transient: if Reynolds number is greater than 2,100 and less than 10,000
* Turbulent: if Reynolds number is greater than 10,000

What we can see is that from any of these three states we can go to any other state. This type of discontinuities
is called a **reversible discontinuity** and can be described by the
:py:meth:`~pyCore.daeModel.IF`, :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeModel.ELSE_IF`, :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeModel.ELSE`
state transient network functions.
In **pyDAE** it is given by the following statement:

.. code-block:: python

    IF(Re() <= 2100)                      # (Laminar flow)
    #... (equations go here)

    ELSE_IF(Re() > 2100 and Re() < 10000) # (Transient flow)
    #... (equations go here)

    ELSE()                                # (Turbulent flow)
    #... (equations go here)

    END_IF()

while in **cDAE** by:

.. code-block:: cpp

    IF(Re() <= 2100);                      // (Laminar flow)
    //... (equations go here)

    ELSE_IF(Re() > 2100 && Re() < 10000);  // (Transient flow)
    //... (equations go here)

    ELSE();                                // (Turbulent flow)
    //... (equations go here)

    END_IF();

**Reversible discontinuities** can be **symmetrical** and **non-symmetrical**. The above example is **symmetrical**.
However, if we have a CPU and we want to model its power dissipation we may have three operating modes with the
following state transitions:

* Normal mode

  * switch to **Power saving mode** if CPU load is below 5%
  * switch to **Fried mode** if the temperature is above 110 degrees

* Power saving mode

  * switch to **Normal mode** if CPU load is above 5%
  * switch to **Fried mode** if the temperature is above 110 degrees

* Fried mode (no escape from here... go to the nearest shop and buy a new one!)

What we can see is that from the **Normal mode** we can either go to the **Power saving mode** or to the **Fried mode**.
The same stands for the **Power saving mode**: we can either go to the **Normal mode** or to the **Fried mode**.
However, once the temperature exceeds 110 degrees the CPU dies (let's say we heavily overclocked it) and there
is no going back. This type of discontinuities is called an **irreversible discontinuity** and can be described by
using  :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeModel.STN`, :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeModel.STATE`, :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeModel.END_STN` 
functions while state transitions using :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeModel.ON_CONDITION` function.
In **pyDAE** this type of state transitions is given by the following statement:

.. code-block:: python

    STN("CPU")

    STATE("Normal")
    #... (equations go here)
    ON_CONDITION(CPULoad() < 0.05, switchToState = "PowerSaving")
    ON_CONDITION(T() > 110,        switchToState = "Fried")

    STATE("PowerSaving")
    #... (equations go here)
    ON_CONDITION(CPULoad() >= 0.05, switchToState = "Normal")
    ON_CONDITION(T() > 110,         switchToState = "Fried")

    STATE("Normal")
    #... (equations go here)

    END_STN()

while in **cDAE** by:

.. code-block:: cpp

    STN("CPU");

    STATE("Normal");
    //... (equations go here)
    ON_CONDITION(CPULoad() < 0.05, switchToState = "PowerSaving");
    ON_CONDITION(T() > 110,        switchToState = "Fried");


    STATE("PowerSaving");
    //... (equations go here)
    ON_CONDITION(CPULoad() >= 0.05, switchToState = "Normal");
    ON_CONDITION(T() > 110,         switchToState = "Fried");

    STATE("Normal");
    //... (equations go here)

    END_STN();

More information about state transition networks can be found in :doc:`pyDAE_user_guide` and :py:class:`pyCore.daeSTN`.
Also, do not forget to have a look on :doc:`tutorials`.

Ports
-----

Ports are used to connect two models. Like models, they may contain domains, parameters and variables. For instance,
in **pyDAE** ports can be defined by the following statements:

.. code-block:: python

    class myPort(daePort):
        def __init__(self, Name, Type, Parent = None, Description = ""):
            daePort.__init__(self, Name, Type, Parent, Description)
            #... (here go declarations of domains, parameters and variables)

while in **cDAE** by:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class myPort : public daePort
    {
    public:
    myPort(string strName, daeePortType eType, daeModel* pParent, string strDescription = "")
            : daePort(strName, eType, pParent, strDescription)
        {
            //... (here go additional properties of domains, parameters and variables)
        }

    public:
        //... (here go declarations of domains, parameters and variables)
    };

Also, do not forget to have a look on :doc:`tutorials`.

Event Ports
-----------

Event ports are also used to connect two models; however, they allow sending of discrete messages (events) between
model instances. Events can be triggered manually or as a result of a state transition in a model. The main difference
between event and ordinary ports is that the former allow a discrete communication between model instances while
latter allow a continuous exchange of information. A single outlet event port can be connected to unlimited number
of inlet event ports. Messages contain a floating point value that can be used by a recipient (these actions are
specified in :py:meth:`~pyCore.daeModel.ON_EVENT` function); that value might be a simple number or an expression
involving model variables/parameters.

More information about event ports can be found in :doc:`pyDAE_user_guide` and :py:class:`pyCore.daeEventPort`.
Also, do not forget to have a look on :doc:`tutorials`.

Simulation
----------
As it was mentioned before, simulation of a process can be considered as the model run for certain input conditions.
To define a simulation in **DAE Tools** the following tasks have to be done:

1. Derive a new simulation class

 * Specify a model to simulate
 * Specify its domains and parameters information
 * Fix the degrees of freedom by assigning the values to certain variables
 * Set the initial conditions for differential variables
 * Set the other variables' information: initial guesses, absolute tolerances, etc
 * Specify the operating procedure. It can be either a simple run for a specified period of time (default) or
   a complex one where various actions can be taken during the simulation

2. Specify DAE and LA solvers

3. Specify a data reporter and a data receiver, and connect them

4. Set a time horizon, reporting interval, etc

5. Do the initialization of the DAE system

6. Save model report and/or runtime model report (to inspect expanded equations etc)

7. Run the simulation

Simulations in **pyDAE** can be defined by the following construct:

.. code-block:: python

    class mySimulation(daeSimulation):
        def __init__(self):
            daeSimulation.__init__(self)
            self.m = myModel("myModel", "Description")

        def SetUpParametersAndDomains(self):
            #... (here we set up domains and parameters)

        def SetUpVariables(self):
            #... (here we set up degrees of freedom, initial conditions, initial guesses, etc)

        def Run(self):
            #... (here goes a custom operating procedure, if needed)

while in **cDAE** by:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class mySimulation : public daeSimulation
    {
    public:
        mySimulation(void) : m("myModel", "Description")
        {
            SetModel(&m);
        }

    public:
        void SetUpParametersAndDomains(void)
        {
            //... (here we set up domains and parameters)
        }

        void SetUpVariables(void)
        {
            //... (here we set up degrees of freedom, initial conditions, initial guesses, etc)
        }

        void Run(void)
        {
            //... (here goes a custom operating procedure, if needed)
        }

    public:
        myModel m;
    };

Running a simulation
--------------------

Simulations in **pyDAE** can be run in two modes:

#. By using PyQt4 graphical user interface (GUI)
#. From the shell

1. Running a simulation from the GUI (**pyDAE** only)

 Here the default log, and data reporter objects will be used, while the user can choose DAE and LA solvers and
 specify time horizon and reporting interval.

.. code-block:: python

    # Import modules
    import sys
    from time import localtime, strftime
    from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui

    # Create QtApplication object
    app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)

    # Create simulation object
    sim = simTutorial()

    # Report ALL variables in the model
    sim.m.SetReportingOn(True)

    # Show the daeSimulator window to choose the other information needed for simulation
    simulator  = daeSimulator(app, simulation=sim)
    simulator.show()

    # Execute applications main loop
    app.exec_()

2. Running a simulation from the shell:

In **pyDAE**:

.. code-block:: python

    # Import modules
    import sys
    from time import localtime, strftime

    # Create Log, Solver, DataReporter and Simulation object
    log          = daeStdOutLog()
    solver       = daeIDAS()
    datareporter = daeTCPIPDataReporter()
    simulation   = simTutorial()

    # Set the linear solver (optional)
    lasolver     = pyTrilinosAmesos.CreateTrilinosAmesosSolver("Amesos_Superlu")
    solver.SetLASolver(eThirdParty, lasolver)

    # Report ALL variables in the model
    simulation.m.SetReportingOn(True)

    # Set the time horizon (1000 seconds) and the reporting interval (10 seconds)
    simulation.SetReportingInterval(10)
    simulation.SetTimeHorizon(1000)

    # Connect data reporter (use the default TCP/IP connection string)
    simName = simulation.m.Name + strftime(" [m.%Y %H:%M:%S]", localtime())
    if(datareporter.Connect("", simName) == False):
        sys.exit()

    # Initialize the simulation
    simulation.Initialize(solver, datareporter, log)

    # Solve at time = 0 (initialization)
    simulation.SolveInitial()

    # Run
    simulation.Run()
    simulation.Finalize()

while in **cDAE** by:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Create Log, Solver, DataReporter and Simulation object
    boost::scoped_ptr<daeSimulation_t>    pSimulation(new simTutorial);
    boost::scoped_ptr<daeDataReporter_t>  pDataReporter(daeCreateTCPIPDataReporter());
    boost::scoped_ptr<daeIDASolver>       pDAESolver(daeCreateIDASolver());
    boost::scoped_ptr<daeLog_t>           pLog(daeCreateStdOutLog());

    // Report ALL variables in the model
    pSimulation->GetModel()->SetReportingOn(true);

    // Set the time horizon and the reporting interval
    pSimulation->SetReportingInterval(10);
    pSimulation->SetTimeHorizon(100);

    // Connect data reporter
    string strName = pSimulation->GetModel()->GetName();
    if(!pDataReporter->Connect("", strName))
        return;

    // Initialize the simulation
    pSimulation->Initialize(pDAESolver.get(), pDataReporter.get(), pLog.get());

    // Solve at time = 0 (initialization)
    pSimulation->SolveInitial();

    // Run
    pSimulation->Run();
    pSimulation->Finalize();

Optimization
------------

To define an optimization problem it is first necessary to develop a model of the process and to define
a simulation (as explained above). Having done these tasks (working model and simulation) the optimization
in **DAE Tools** can be defined by specifying the objective function, optimization variables and optimization
constraints. It is intentionally chosen to keep simulation and optimization tightly coupled. The optimization
problem should be specified in the function :py:meth:`~pyActivity.daeSimulation.SetUpOptimization`.
The tasks have to be done are:

1. Specify the objective function

 * Objective function is defined by specifying its residual (similarly to specifying an equation residual);
   Internally the framework will create a new variable (V_obj) and a new equation (F_obj).

2. Specify optimization variables

 * The optimization variables have to be already defined in the model and their values assigned in the simulation;
   they can be either non-distributed or distributed.
 * Specify a type of optimization variable values. The variables can be **continuous** (floating point values in
   the given range), **integer** (set of integer values in the given range) or **binary** (integer value: 0 or 1).
 * Specify the starting point (within the range)

3. Specify optimization constraints

 * Two types of constraints exist in DAE Tools: **equality** and **inequality** constraints
   To define an **equality** constraint its residual and the value has to be specified;
   To define an **inequality** constraint its residual, the lower and upper bounds have to be specified;
   Internally the framework will create a new variable (V_constraint[N]) and a new equation (F_constraint[N])
   for each defined constraint, where N is the ordinal number of the constraint.

4. Specify NLP/MINLP solver

 * Currently **BONMIN** MINLP solver and **IPOPT** and **NLOPT** solvers are supported (the **BONMIN**
   solver internally uses **IPOPT** to solve NLP problems)

5. Specify DAE and LA solvers

6. Specify a data reporter and a data receiver, and connect them

7. Set a time horizon, reporting interval, etc

8. Set the options of the (MI)NLP solver

9. Initialize the optimization

10. Save model report and/or runtime model report (to inspect expanded equations etc)

11. Run the optimization

:py:meth:`~pyActivity.daeSimulation.SetUpOptimization` function is declared in **pyDAE** as the following:

.. code-block:: python

    class mySimulation(daeSimulation):
        #... (here we set up a simulation)

        def SetUpOptimization(self):
            #... (here goes a declaration of the obj. function, opt. variables and constraints)

while in **cDAE** by:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class mySimulation : public daeSimulation
    {
        //... (here we set up a simulation)

        void SetUpOptimization(void)
        {
            //... (here goes a declaration of the obj. function, opt. variables and constraints)
        }
    };

Running the optimization
------------------------

Optimizations, like simulations in **pyDAE** can be run in two modes:

#. By using PyQt4 graphical user interface (GUI)
#. From the shell

1. Running an optimization from the GUI (**pyDAE** only)

    app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)

    # Create simulation object
    sim = simTutorial()
    nlp = daeBONMIN()

    # Report ALL variables in the model
    sim.m.SetReportingOn(True)

    # Show the daeSimulator window to choose the other information needed for optimization
    simulator = daeSimulator(app, simulation=sim, nlpsolver=nlp)
    simulator.show()

    # Execute applications main loop
    app.exec_()

    from time import localtime, strftime

    # Create Log, NLPSolver, DAESolver, DataReporter, Simulation and Optimization objects
    log          = daePythonStdOutLog()
    daesolver    = daeIDAS()
    nlpsolver    = daeBONMIN()
    datareporter = daeTCPIPDataReporter()
    simulation   = simTutorial()
    optimization = daeOptimization()

    # Enable reporting of all variables
    simulation.m.SetReportingOn(True)

    # Set the time horizon and the reporting interval
    simulation.ReportingInterval = 10
    simulation.TimeHorizon = 100

    # Connect data reporter
    simName = simulation.m.Name + strftime(" [m.%Y %H:%M:%S]", localtime())
    if(datareporter.Connect("", simName) == False):
        sys.exit()

    # Initialize the simulation
    optimization.Initialize(simulation, nlpsolver, daesolver, datareporter, log)

    # Set the MINLP solver options (optional)
    #nlpsolver.SetOption('OPTION', VALUE)
    #nlpsolver.LoadOptionsFile("")

    # Save the model report and the runtime model report
    simulation.m.SaveModelReport(simulation.m.Name + ".xml")
    simulation.m.SaveRuntimeModelReport(simulation.m.Name + "-rt.xml")

    # Run
    optimization.Run()
    optimization.Finalize()

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Create Log, NLPSolver, DAESolver, DataReporter, Simulation and Optimization objects

Processing the results
----------------------

The simulation/optimization results can be easily plotted by using **DAE Plotter** application.
It is possible to choose between 2D and 3D plots. After choosing a desired type, a **Choose variable**
(given in :ref:`Figure 5. <Figure-5>`) dialog appears where a user has to select a variable to plot and specify information
about domains - fix some of them while leaving another free by selecting `*` from the list (to create a 2D plot
you need one domain free, while for a 3D plot you need two free domains).
