<h1>Programming paradigms<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-paradigms" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>In general, there are two types of approaches that can be applied to process modelling:
Domain Specific Language approach and a general-purpose programming language approach (such as
c/c++, Java or Python). A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is a special-purpose programming or
specification language dedicated to a particular problem domain and so designed that it directly
supports the key concepts necessary to describe the underlying problems. A domain-specific
language is created specifically to solve problems in a particular domain and is usually not
intended to be able to solve problems outside it (although that may be technically possible in
some cases). In contrast, general-purpose languages are created to solve problems in a wide
variety of application domains.</p>
<p>Domain-specific languages are languages with very specific goals in design and implementation and
commonly lack low-level functions for filesystem access, interprocess control, and other functions
that characterize full-featured programming languages, scripting or otherwise.</p>
<p>A good example of general purpose (multi-domain) domain specific language is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.modelica.org">Modelica</a>
while single-domain (chemical processing industry related) DSLs are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.psenterprise.com/gproms">gPROMS</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://ascend4.org">Ascend</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aspentech.com">SpeedUp</a> etc.</p>
<p><strong>DAE Tools</strong> approach is a sort of the hybrid approach: it applies general-purpose programming languages
such as c++ and Python, but offers a class-hierarchy/API that resembles a syntax of a DSL as much as
possible, an access to the low-level functions, large number of standard and third party libraries and
uses state of the art free/open-source software components to accomplish particular tasks (calculating
derivatives and sensitivities, solving systems of differential and algebraic systems of equations and
optimization problems, processing and plotting results etc).</p>

<p><strong>DAE Tools</strong> provide low-level concepts such as parameters, variables, equations, ports, models,
state transition networks, discrete events etc. so that the key concepts from new application domains
can be added on top of those low level concepts. For instance, the key modelling concepts from the
simulator-independent xml-based domain specific language for modelling of biological neural
networks <a class="reference external" href="http://software.incf.org/software/nineml">NineML</a> such as neurones, synapses, connectivity
patterns, populations of neurones etc. are based on <strong>DAE Tools</strong> concepts.</p>

<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>Domain-specific languages allow solutions to be expressed in the idiom and at the level of abstraction
of the problem domain (direct support for all modelling concepts by the language syntax)</td>
<td>Modelling concepts cannot be expressed directly in the programming language and have to be emulated in
the API or in some other way</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Clean, concise, ellegant and natural way of building model descriptions: the code can be self documenting</td>
<td>The support for modelling concepts is much more verbose and less elegant; however, DAE Tools can generate
XML+MathML based model reports that can be either rendered in XHTML format using XSLT transformations
(representing the code documentation) or used as an XML-based model exchange language.</td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td>DSLs could be and often are simulator independent making a model exchange easier</td>
<td>Programming language dependent; however, a large number of scientific software libraries exposes its
functionality to Python via Python wrappers</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Cost of designing, implementing, and maintaining a domain-specific language as well as the tools required
to develop with it (IDE): a compiler/lexical parser/interpreter must be developed with all burden that comes
with it (such as error handling, grammar ambiguities, hidden bugs etc)</td>
<td>A compiler/lexical parser/interpreter is an integral part of the programming language (c++, Python) with a
robust error handling, universal grammar and massively tested</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Cost of learning a new language vs. its limited applicability: users are required to master a new language
(yet another language grammar)</td>
<td>No learning of a new language required (everything can get done in a favourite programming language)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Increased difficulty of integrating the DSL with other components: calling external functions/libraries and
interaction with other software is limited by the existence of wrappers around a simulator engine
(for instance some scripting languages like Python or javascript)</td>
<td>Calling external functions/libraries is a natural and straightforward Interaction with other software is
natural and straightforward</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td>Setting up a simulation (ie. the values of parameters values, initial conditions, initially active states)

some other software (for example to chain several software calls where outputs of previous calls represent
inputs to the subsequent ones)</td>
<td>Setting up a simulation is done programmaticaly and the initial values can be obtained from some other software
in a natural way (chaining several software calls is easy since a large number of libraries make Python wrappers
available)</td>

a user cosiders suitable for his/her problem</td>

possible or if a simulator does provide a way to build extensions it is limited to the functionality made

programming language itself)</td>
