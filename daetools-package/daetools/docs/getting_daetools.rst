* python-h5py
* python-pandas

Optional packages (proprietary):

* Pardiso linear solver: `<http://www.pardiso-project.org>`_
* Intel Pardiso linear solver: `<https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl>`_

For more information on how to install packages please refer to the documentation for the specific library.
By default all versions (GNU/Linux, Windows and MacOS) come with the Sundials dense LU and Lapack linear
solvers, SuperLU, SuperLU_MT, Trilinos Amesos (with built-in support for KLU, SuperLU and Lapack linear solvers),
Trilinos AztecOO (with built-in support for Ifpack and ML preconditioners), NLOPT and IPOPT/BONMIN
(with MUMPS linear solver and PORD ordering).

Additional linear solvers (such as Pardiso and IntelPardiso) must be downloaded
separately since they are subject to different licencing conditions (not free software).

Getting the packages
====================

The instalation files can be downloaded from the `downloads <http://daetools.com/downloads.html>`_ section
or from the `SourceForge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/daetools/files>`_ website.

.. note:: From the version 1.2.1 **DAE Tools** use distutils to distribute python packages and extensions.

The naming convention of the installation files:

``daetools-major.minor.build-platform-architecture-python_version.tar.gz``

where ``major.minor.build`` represents the version (``1.5.0`` for instance), ``architecture`` could be ``i686``, ``x86_64``
or ``universal``, and ``python_version`` can be ``py27``, ``py34`` etc. An example:
``daetools-1.5.0-gnu_linux-x86_64-py27.tar.gz`` is the version 1.5.0 for 64 bit GNU/Linux with python 2.7.

For the other platforms, architectures and python versions not listed in `System requirements`_
daetools must be compiled from the source.
The source code can be downloaded either from the subversion tree or from the folder with a particular version
(``daetools-1.5.0-source.tar.gz`` for instance).

    Additional linear equation solvers (proprietary)
    ------------------------------------------------
    Optionally you can also install proprietary `AMD ACML <http://www.amd.com/acml>`_ and
    `Intel MKL <http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/>`_ libraries.
    Please follow the installation procedures in the documentation. **pyAmdACML** and **pyIntelMKL/pyIntelPardiso**
    modules are compiled against ACML 4.4.0 and MKL 10.2.5.035 respectively. Also have a look on the licensing
    conditions (**these libraries are not** `**free software** <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>`_).

    In order to use AMD ACML and Intel MKL libraries you have to do some additional configuration.
    You can follow the instructions in the corresponding package documentation or do a quick setup as described below:

    #**GNU/Linux**: setup for a single user<br /> Copy `<acml_mkl_bashrc this file>`_ to your home folder,
    edit it so that it reflects your installation and add the line. $HOME/acml_mkl_bashrc  at the end of $HOME/.bashrc file
    #**GNU/Linux**: setup for all users<br /> Subject to your machine architecture and library versions
    (here **x86_64** GNU/Linux with **ACML v4.4.0** and **MKL v10.2.5.035**), put the following lines in
    /etc/ld.so.conf and execute ldconfig: /opt/intel/mkl/10.2.5.035/lib/em64t /opt/acml4.4.0/gfortran64_mp/lib
    #**Windows XP**:<br /> If not already added, add the following line to your **PATH** environment variable
    (Control Panel -> System): c:\AMD\acml4.4.0\ifort32_mp\lib;c:\Intel\MKL\10.2.5.035\ia32\bin\

    
Compiling from source
=====================

To compile the **DAE Tools** the following is needed:
    
* Installed python, numpy, and scipy modules
* Compiled third party libraries and DAE/LA/NLP solvers: Sundials IDAS, Bonmin, NLopt, Trilinos, SuperLU, SuperLU_MT,
  Blas/Lapack

All **DAE Tools** modules are developed using the QtCreator/QMake cross-platform integrated development environment.
The source code can be downloaded from the SourceForge website or checked out from the
`DAE Tools subversion repository <https://svn.code.sf.net/p/daetools/code>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/daetools/code daetools


GNU/Linux and MacOS
-------------------

.. _from_the_command_line:

From the command line
+++++++++++++++++++++
First, install all the necessary dependencies by executing ``install_python_dependencies_linux.sh`` and
``install_dependencies_linux.sh`` shell script located in the ``trunk`` directory.
They will check the OS you are running (currently Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, CentOS, Suse Linux,
Arch Linux and Fedora are supported but other can be easily added) and install all necessary packages needed for **DAE Tools**
development.

.. code-block:: bash

    # 'lsb_release' command might be missing on some GNU/Linux platforms
    # and has to be installed before proceeding.
    # On Debian based systems:
    # sudo apt-get install lsb-release
    # On red Hat based systems:
    # sudo yum install redhat-lsb

    cd daetools/trunk
    sh install_dependencies_linux.sh


Then, compile the third party libraries by executing ``compile_libraries_linux.sh`` shell script located in the
``trunk`` directory. The script will download all necessary source archives from the **DAE Tools** SourceForge web-site,
unpack them, apply changes and compile them. If all dependencies are installed there should not be problems compiling
the libraries.

.. code-block:: bash

    sh compile_libraries_linux.sh all

.. note:: There are known problems to compile the older bonmin and trilinos libraries using GNU GCC 4.6. This has been fixed
          in bonmin 1.5+ and trilinos 10.8+ versions. Therefore, either GCC 4.5 and below or the recent
          versions of bonmin/trilinos libraries should be used.

Finally, compile the **DAE Tools** libraries and python modules by executing ``compile_linux.sh`` shell script located
in the ``trunk`` directory. The script accepts one argument specifying projects that should be compiled. Any of the
following is accepted: ``all``, ``core``, ``pydae``, ``solvers``, ``superlu``, ``superlu_mt``, ``superlu_cuda``,
``cusp``, ``trilinos``, ``bonmin``, ``ipopt``, and ``nlopt``. If ``all`` is specified the script will compile
``dae``, ``superlu``, ``superlu_mt``, ``trilinos``, ``bonmin``, ``ipopt``, and ``nlopt`` projects.

.. code-block:: bash

    sh compile_linux.sh all
    # Or for instance:
    # sh compile_linux.sh dae superlu nlopt


All python extensions are located in platform-dependent locations in ``trunk/daetools-package/daetools/pyDAE`` and
``trunk/daetools-package/daetools/solvers`` folders.

**DAE Tools** can be now installed using the information from the sections above.

.. _from_qtcreator_ide:

From QtCreator IDE
++++++++++++++++++
DAE Tools can also be compiled from within QtCreator IDE. First install dependencies and compile third party libraries
(as explained in the compilation :ref:`from the command line <from_the_command_line>`) and then do the following:
    
* Do not do the shadow build. Uncheck it (for all projects) and build everything in the release folder
* Choose the right specification file for your platform (usually it is done automatically by the IDE, but double-check it):
    
  * for GNU/Linux use ``-spec linux-g++``
  * for MacOS use ``-spec macx-g++``

* Compile the ``dae`` project (you can add the additional Make argument ``-jN`` to speed-up the compilation process,
  where N is the number of processors plus one; for instance on the quad-core machine you can use ``-j5``)
* Compile ``SuperLU/SuperLU_MT/SuperLU_CUDA`` and ``Bonmin/Ipopt`` solvers.
  ``SuperLU/SuperLU_MT/SuperLU_CUDA`` and ``Bonmin/Ipopt`` share the same code and the same project file so some
  hacking is needed. Here are the instructions how to compile them:
    
  * Compiling ``libcdaeBONMIN_MINLPSolver.a`` and ``pyBONMIN.so``:
 
    * Set ``CONFIG += BONMIN`` in ``BONMIN_MINLPSolver.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
    * Set ``CONFIG += BONMIN`` in ``pyBONMIN.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
  
  * Compiling ``libcdaeIPOPT_NLPSolver.a`` and ``pyIPOPT.so``:
 
    * Set ``CONFIG += IPOPT`` in ``BONMIN_MINLPSolver.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
    * Set ``CONFIG += IPOPT`` in ``pyBONMIN.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
  
  * Compiling ``libcdaeSuperLU_LASolver.a`` and ``pySuperLU.so``:
 
    * Set ``CONFIG += SuperLU`` in ``LA_SuperLU.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
    * Set ``CONFIG += SuperLU`` in ``pySuperLU.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
  
  * Compiling ``libcdaeSuperLU_MT_LASolver.a`` and ``pySuperLU_MT.so``:
 
    * Set ``CONFIG += SuperLU_MT`` in ``LA_SuperLU.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
    * Set ``CONFIG += SuperLU_MT`` in ``pySuperLU.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
  
  * Compiling ``libcdaeSuperLU_CUDA_LASolver.a`` and ``pySuperLU_CUDA.so``:
 
    * Set ``CONFIG += SuperLU_CUDA`` in ``LA_SuperLU.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
    * Set ``CONFIG += SuperLU_CUDA`` in ``pySuperLU.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile

* Compile the ``LA_Trilinos_Amesos`` project

Windows
-------
DAE Tools support cross-compilation since the version 1.3.0. For more information about the gcc toolchain and options
read the help sections in compile_libraries_linux.sh and compile_linux.sh scripts.

.. note:: Compiling all third party libraries and **DAE Tools** projects requires a mental gymnastics
          impossible to describe by any human language.

..
    Necessary tools: `QtCreator <http://qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools>`_,
    `Microsoft VC++ <http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=14597>`_
    and `G95 Fortran <http://www.g95.org>`_ compiler (Mumps only).

    **DAE Tools** should be compiled from within QtCreator IDE:

    * Unpack the downloaded archive ``bonmin-trilinos-idas-superlu-nlopt-mumps-g95-msvc-win32.zip`` into the
    ``daetools/trunk`` folder. All libraries are compiled with MS VC++ 2008 Express edition (the most likely other
    versions of MS VC++ will also work). Mumps Fortran 95 files are compiled with G95 Fortran compiler.

    * Path to ``libf95.a`` and ``libgcc.a`` libraries should be set in ``dae.pri`` config file.
    For instance, if G95 is installed in ``c:\g95`` set the ``G95_LIBDIR`` variable to:
    ``G95_LIBDIR = c:\g95\lib\gcc-lib\i686-pc-mingw32\4.1.2``

    * Follow the instructions for compiling **DAE Tools** described in :ref:`From QtCreator IDE <from_qtcreator_ide>` section above.

    .. note:: superlu_mt and superlu_cuda cannot be compiled on Windows at the moment.

**DAE Tools** can be now installed using the information from the sections above.
