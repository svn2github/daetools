Getting the packages
====================

The installation files can be downloaded from the `downloads <http://daetools.com/downloads.html>`_ section
or from the `SourceForge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/daetools/files>`_ website.

.. topic:: Nota bene

    From the version 1.2.1 **DAE Tools** use distutils to distribute python packages and extensions.

.. topic:: Nota bene

    From the version 1.6.0 Windows installer is not provided anymore.

The naming convention for the installation files: ``daetools-major.minor.platform-architecture.tar.gz``
where ``major.minor.build`` represents the version (``1.7.1`` for instance),
``platform`` can be ``gnu_linux``, ``win32`` and ``macosx``, and
``architecture`` can be ``i686``, ``x86_64`` or ``universal``.

An example: ``daetools-1.7.1-gnu_linux-x86_64.tar.gz`` is the version 1.7.1 for 64 bit GNU/Linux.

For other platforms, architectures and python versions not listed in `System requirements`_
daetools must be compiled from the source.
The source code can be downloaded either from the subversion tree or from the download section

    Additional linear equation solvers (proprietary)
    ------------------------------------------------
    Optionally you can also install proprietary `AMD ACML <http://www.amd.com/acml>`_ and
    `Intel MKL <http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/>`_ libraries.
    Please follow the installation procedures in the documentation. **pyAmdACML** and **pyIntelMKL/pyIntelPardiso**
    modules are compiled against ACML 4.4.0 and MKL 10.2.5.035 respectively. Also have a look on the licensing
    conditions (**these libraries are not** `**free software** <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>`_).

    In order to use AMD ACML and Intel MKL libraries you have to do some additional configuration.
    You can follow the instructions in the corresponding package documentation or do a quick setup as described below:

    #**GNU/Linux**: setup for a single user<br /> Copy `<acml_mkl_bashrc this file>`_ to your home folder,
    edit it so that it reflects your installation and add the line. $HOME/acml_mkl_bashrc  at the end of $HOME/.bashrc file
    #**GNU/Linux**: setup for all users<br /> Subject to your machine architecture and library versions
    (here **x86_64** GNU/Linux with **ACML v4.4.0** and **MKL v10.2.5.035**), put the following lines in
    /etc/ld.so.conf and execute ldconfig: /opt/intel/mkl/10.2.5.035/lib/em64t /opt/acml4.4.0/gfortran64_mp/lib
    #**Windows XP**:<br /> If not already added, add the following line to your **PATH** environment variable
    (Control Panel -> System): c:\AMD\acml4.4.0\ifort32_mp\lib;c:\Intel\MKL\10.2.5.035\ia32\bin\

    
Compiling from source
=====================

To compile the **DAE Tools** the following is needed:
    
* Installed ``python`` and ``numpy`` modules
* Compiled third party libraries and DAE/LA/NLP solvers: ``Boost``, ``Sundials IDAS``, ``Trilinos``,
  ``SuperLU``, ``SuperLU_MT``, ``Bonmin``, ``NLopt``, ``deal.II``, ``blas``, ``lapack``

All **DAE Tools** modules are developed using the QtCreator/QMake cross-platform integrated development environment.
The source code can be downloaded from the SourceForge website or checked out from the
`DAE Tools subversion repository <https://svn.code.sf.net/p/daetools/code>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/daetools/code daetools


GNU/Linux and MacOS
-------------------

.. _from_the_command_line:

From the command line
+++++++++++++++++++++
First, install all the necessary dependencies by executing ``install_python_dependencies_linux.sh`` and
``install_dependencies_linux.sh`` shell script located in the ``trunk`` directory.
They will check the OS you are running (currently Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, CentOS, Suse Linux,
Arch Linux and Fedora are supported but other can be easily added) and install all necessary packages needed for **DAE Tools**
development.

.. code-block:: bash

    # 'lsb_release' command might be missing on some GNU/Linux platforms
    # and has to be installed before proceeding.
    # On Debian based systems:
    # sudo apt-get install lsb-release
    # On red Hat based systems:
    # sudo yum install redhat-lsb

    cd daetools/trunk
    sh install_dependencies_linux.sh

Then, compile all the third party libraries by executing ``compile_libraries.sh`` shell script located in the
``trunk`` directory. The script will download all necessary source archives from the **DAE Tools** SourceForge web-site,
unpack them, apply changes and compile them. If all dependencies are installed there should not be problems compiling
the libraries.

.. code-block:: bash

    sh compile_libraries.sh all

It is also possible to compile individual libraries using one of the following options:

.. code-block:: none

    all    All libraries and solvers.
           On GNU/Linux and macOS equivalent to: boost ref_blas_lapack umfpack idas superlu superlu_mt ipopt bonmin nlopt 
                                                 coolprop trilinos deal.ii
           On Windows equivalent to: boost cblas_clapack mumps idas superlu ipopt bonmin nlopt coolprop trilinos deal.ii

    Individual libraries/solvers:
      boost            Boost libraries (system, filesystem, thread, python)
      ref_blas_lapack  reference BLAS and Lapack libraries
      cblas_clapack    CBLAS and CLapack libraries
      mumps            Mumps linear solver
      umfpack          Umfpack solver
      idas             IDAS solver
      superlu          SuperLU solver
      superlu_mt       SuperLU_MT solver
      bonmin           Bonmin solver
      nlopt            NLopt solver
      trilinos         Trilinos Amesos and AztecOO solvers
      deal.ii          deal.II finite elements library
      coolprop         CoolProp thermophysical property library

After compilation, the shared libraries will be located in ``trunk/daetools-package/daetools/solibs`` directory.

Finally, compile all **DAE Tools** libraries and python modules by executing ``compile.sh`` shell script located
in the ``trunk`` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    sh compile.sh all

It is also possible to compile individual libraries using one of the following options:

.. code-block:: none

    all             Build all daetools c++ libraries, solvers and python extension modules.
                    On GNU/Linux and macOS equivalent to: dae superlu superlu_mt trilinos ipopt bonmin nlopt deal.ii

``trunk/daetools-package/daetools/solvers`` folders.

**DAE Tools** can be now installed using the information from the sections above.

.. _from_qtcreator_ide:

From QtCreator IDE
++++++++++++++++++
DAE Tools can also be compiled from within QtCreator IDE. First install dependencies and compile third party libraries
(as explained in the compilation :ref:`from the command line <from_the_command_line>`) and then do the following:
    
* Do not do the shadow build. Uncheck it (for all projects) and build everything in the release folder
* Choose the right specification file for your platform (usually it is done automatically by the IDE, but double-check it):
    
  * for GNU/Linux use ``-spec linux-g++``
  * for MacOS use ``-spec macx-g++``

* Compile the ``dae`` project (you can add the additional Make argument ``-jN`` to speed-up the compilation process,
  where N is the number of processors plus one; for instance on the quad-core machine you can use ``-j5``)
* Compile ``SuperLU/SuperLU_MT`` and ``Bonmin/Ipopt`` solvers.
  ``SuperLU/SuperLU_MT`` and ``Bonmin/Ipopt`` share the same code and the same project file so some
  hacking is needed. Here are the instructions how to compile them:
    
  * Compiling ``libcdaeBONMIN_MINLPSolver.a`` and ``pyBONMIN.so``:
 
    * Set ``CONFIG += BONMIN`` in ``BONMIN_MINLPSolver.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
    * Set ``CONFIG += BONMIN`` in ``pyBONMIN.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
  
  * Compiling ``libcdaeIPOPT_NLPSolver.a`` and ``pyIPOPT.so``:
 
    * Set ``CONFIG += IPOPT`` in ``BONMIN_MINLPSolver.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
    * Set ``CONFIG += IPOPT`` in ``pyBONMIN.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
  
  * Compiling ``libcdaeSuperLU_LASolver.a`` and ``pySuperLU.so``:
 
    * Set ``CONFIG += SuperLU`` in ``LA_SuperLU.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
    * Set ``CONFIG += SuperLU`` in ``pySuperLU.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
  
  * Compiling ``libcdaeSuperLU_MT_LASolver.a`` and ``pySuperLU_MT.so``:
 
    * Set ``CONFIG += SuperLU_MT`` in ``LA_SuperLU.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile
    * Set ``CONFIG += SuperLU_MT`` in ``pySuperLU.pro``, run ``qmake`` and then compile

* Compile the ``LA_Trilinos_Amesos`` and then ``pyTrilinos`` project
* Compile the ``NLOPT_NLPSolver`` and then ``pyNLOPT`` project
* Compile the ``pyDealII`` project (no compile needed for ``FE_DealII`` project since all files there are header files/templates)

Windows
-------
.. topic:: Nota bene

    DAE Tools supported cross-compilation in the versions 1.3.0 to 1.6.0.
    New versions support ``native MSVC++ compilers`` (v2015 required for python 3.5 and 3.6).
    For more information about the ``mingw-w64`` toolchain and options read the help sections in 
    ``compile_libraries.sh`` and ``compile.sh`` scripts.

Microsoft VC++
++++++++++++++
First, download and install (a) `Visual Studio Community Edition 2015 <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48146>`_ 
or (b) ``Visual Studio 2017`` and ``VC++ Build Tools 2015``. Python 3.5 and 3.6 are compiled using VC++ 2015 (``msvc++ v14.0``).
Start ``x86`` (32 bit builds) or ``x64`` (64 bit builds) ``Visual C++ 2015 Command Prompt``. Install some software that provides
``bash`` environment. `Git for Windows <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_ has been successfuly tested. During installation,
when asked select the following options:

- Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt
- Use Windows' default console window
- Add all bash commands to the ``PATH`` (nota bene: it might 'hide' some Windows commands such as ``find``):
  i.e. ``C:\Program Files\Git\cmd;C:\Program Files\Git\mingw32\bin;C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin``

Then, compile all the third party libraries except the ``bonmin`` by executing ``compile_libraries.sh`` shell script located in the
``trunk`` directory. The script will download all necessary source archives from the **DAE Tools** SourceForge web-site,
unpack them, apply changes and compile them. If ``wget`` is missing the source archives must be downloaded manually to the ``trunk`` directory.
If all dependencies are installed there should not be problems compiling the libraries.

.. code-block:: bash

    sh compile_libraries.sh all

Next, download `bonmin-1.4.1-msvc++-2015.zip <https://sourceforge.net/projects/daetools/files/windows-libs/bonmin-1.4.1-msvc++-2015.zip/download>`_ 
from the ``DAE Tools`` SourceForge website and unzip it in the ``trunk``. Go to the ``bonmin`` folder and open ``Bonmin.sln`` solution.
Select all projects, open their proprties and make sure the ``Platform Toolset`` is set to ``Visual Studio 2015 (v140)``,
build type (must be Release) and the platform (32 or 64 bit).
The newer compiler versions will also work but the corresponding msvc++ redistributable package must be installed. Build all projects. 
The compiled static libraries will be located in the ``bonmin/build/lib`` directory.

Finally, compile all **DAE Tools** libraries and python modules by executing ``compile.sh`` shell script located
in the ``trunk`` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    sh compile.sh all

..  Cross-compilation (deprecated)
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    First, compile the third party libraries:

    .. code-block:: none

    Prerequisities:
        1. Install the mingw-w64 package from the main Debian repository.

        2. Install Python on Windows using the binary from the python.org website
            and copy it to trunk/PythonXY-arch (i.e. Python34-win32).
            Modify PYTHON_MAJOR and PYTHON_MINOR in the crossCompile section in the dae.pri file (line ~90):
                PYTHON_MAJOR = 3
                PYTHON_MINOR = 4

        3. cmake cross-compilation requires the toolchain file: set it up using -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path_to_toolchain_file].cmake
            Cross-compile .cmake files are provided by daetools and located in the trunk folder.
            cross-compile-i686-w64-mingw32.cmake   file targets a toolchain located in /usr/mingw32-i686 directory.
            cross-compile-x86_64-w64-mingw32.cmake file targets a toolchain located in /usr/mingw32-x86_64 directory.

        4. deal.II specific options:
            The native "expand_instantiations_exe" is required but cannot be run under the build architecture.
            and must be used from the native build.
            Therefore, set up a native deal.II build directory first and run the following command in it:
                make expand_instantiations_exe
            Typically, it is located in the deal.II/common/scripts directory.
            That directory will be added to the PATH environment variable by this script.
            If necessary, modify the line 'export PATH=...:${PATH}' to match the actual location.

        5. Boost specific options:
            boost-python linking will fail. Append the value of:
            ${DAE_CROSS_COMPILE_PYTHON_ROOT}/libs/libpython${PYTHON_MAJOR}${PYTHON_MINOR}.a
            at the end of the failed linking command, re-run it, and manually copy the stage/lib/*.dll(s) to the "daetools/solibs/${PLATFORM}_${HOST_ARCH}" directory.
            Win64 (x86_64-w64-mingw32):
            - Python 2.7 won't compile (probably issues with the MS Universal CRT voodoo mojo)
            - dl and util libraries are missing when compiling with x86_64-w64-mingw32.
            solution: just remove -ldl and -lutil from the linking line.

        6. Trilinos specific options
            i686-w64-mingw32 specific:
            1. In the file:
                - trilinos/packages/teuchos/src/Teuchos_BLAS.cpp
                "template BLAS<...>" (lines 96-104)
                    #ifdef _WIN32
                    #ifdef HAVE_TEUCHOS_COMPLEX
                        template class BLAS<long int, std::complex<float> >;
                        template class BLAS<long int, std::complex<double> >;
                    #endif
                        template class BLAS<long int, float>;
                        template class BLAS<long int, double>;
                    #endif
                should be replaced by "template class BLAS<...>"
            2. In the files:
                - trilinos/packages/ml/src/Utils/ml_epetra_utils.cpp,
                - trilinos/packages/ml/src/Utils/ml_utils.c
                - trilinos/packages/ml/src/MLAPI/MLAPI_Workspace.cpp:
                the functions "gethostname" and "sleep" do not exist
                    a) Add include file:
                        #include <winsock2.h>
                    and if that does not work (getting unresolved _gethostname function in pyTrilinos),
                    then comment-out all "gethostname" occurences (they are not important - just for printing some info)
                    b) Rename sleep() to Sleep() (if needed, wasn't needed for 10.12.2)

            x86_64-w64-mingw32 specific:
            All the same as above. Additionally:
            1. trilinos/packages/teuchos/src/Teuchos_SerializationTraits.hpp
                Comment lines: UndefinedSerializationTraits<T>::notDefined();
            2. trilinos/packages/epetra/src/Epetra_C_wrappers.cpp
                Add lines at the beggining of the file:
                #pragma GCC diagnostic push
                #pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-fpermissive"

    Cross compiling notes:
        1. Requirements for Boost:
            --with-python-version 3.4
            --cross-compile-python-root .../trunk/Python34-win32
            --host i686-w64-mingw32

        2. The other libraries:
            --host i686-w64-mingw32 (the only necessary)

    Example cross-compile call:
        sh compile_libraries_linux.sh --with-python-version 3.4 --cross-compile-python-root ~/daetools-win32-cross/trunk/Python34-win32 --host i686-w64-mingw32 boost
        sh compile_libraries_linux.sh --host i686-w64-mingw32 ref_blas_lapack umfpack idas superlu superlu_mt trilinos bonmin nlopt deal.ii

    Finally, compile all **DAE Tools** libraries and python modules by executing ``compile_linux.sh`` shell script located
    in the ``trunk`` directory.

    .. code-block:: bash

        sh compile_linux.sh --host i686-w64-mingw32 all

    **DAE Tools** can be now installed using the information from the sections above.
